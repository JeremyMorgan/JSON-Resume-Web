# JSON Resume Web
Vue web app that displays your resume from a JSON file. 

This is part of the [Code Portfolio Challenge](https://www.allhandsontech.com/programming/code-portfolio-challenge/). 

The rules for the chalenge:

- Create a JSON file with your job history in your own format
- Include information like your name, contact information, personal statement, key points and job experience
- Use JavaScript to render it to HTML (a front-end framework like Vue or React will save some time)
- Add it to your GitHub public repository and share your project in Discord

This solutions uses [vuejs](https://github.com/vuejs) to render out elements from the sample file at [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).
